<small>What is Earthquake PH about?</small>
<hr>
<p>Earthquake PH is a website that gives details about earthquakes in the Philippines in a understandable manner through, descriptions and map visualizations of where earthquakes are. This site was created to make the general public informed about details about earthquakes making information understandable to the normal citizen.</p>
<h1 class="post-title">How It Works</h1>
<small>A glimpse to the implemenation of Earthquake PH</small>
<hr>
<p>This site uses the Twitter API to scrape the most recent tweets from the PHIVOLCS account every ten minutes. From the recent tweets, we filter to them to get tweets specifically regarding earthquake information. Next we parsed the information from the full text of the Tweet to get the following information:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Date and Time</li>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Latitude</li>
    <li>Longitude</li>
    <li>Strength or Magnitude</li>
    <li>Depth of Focus</li>
</ul>
<p>After this we run the coordinates to a reverse Geocoder to give us an address of where the epicenter of the earthquake is and then save it to our database.</p>
